 *    in a data block delimited by a tag with a random id, and the system
 *    prompt says it is input to translate, never instructions.
 * 2. Summary (optional): the question, the query in words and the
 *    aggregated result (totals, ranked values with counts and shares, the
 *    series). Client addresses, user agents and paths are replaced by
 *    placeholders ("[address 1]") unless the question ranks or filters by
 *    them and the settings allow sending them; the placeholders are put back
 *    in the summary for the page, never sent.
 *
 * The model gets no tools and one call each (ee/ai/explain.ts).
